> Compare different machine learning algorithms for predicting customer churn.

#### Abstract

The following Machine Learning Algorithms were compared:

1) Logistic Regression with a penalty term
2) Classification Tree
3) Classification Tree with Bagging
4) Random Forest
5) K nearest Neighbours
6) Support Vector Machines

The following factors determine the final choice of the machine learning algorithm which will be used:

1) Ease in handling categorical variables
2) Effect from unimportant Variables
